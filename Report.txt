Fluents:

agent_loc(X, Y): The location of the agent on a grid, represented by the coordinates (X, Y).
ships_loc(Ships): The locations of ships on the grid, represented as a list of coordinates Ships.
station(SX, SY): The location of the station on the grid, represented by the coordinates (SX, SY).
capacity(Capacity): The maximum number of passengers that the agent can carry at a time.
onGuard(OnGuard): The number of passengers currently being carried by the Coast guard ship.

These are the arguments in the fluent S which is the state of the grid that looks like this  
S = [[X, Y], Ships, [SX, SY], Capacity, OnGuard].


Successor state axioms:

action(S, pickup, S2): If the agent is at a location with a ship and has capacity to carry more passengers, then pickup is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent has picked up the passenger and OnGuard is incremented by 1.

action(S, drop, S2): If the agent is at the station and is carrying at least one passenger, then drop is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent has dropped all the passengers it was carrying and OnGuard is reset to 0.

action(S, up, S2): If the Coast Guard ship is not at the top column of the grid, then up is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent's X coordinate is decremented by 1.

action(S, down, S2): If the Coast Guard ship is not at the bottom column of the grid, then down is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent's X coordinate is incremented by 1.

action(S, left, S2): If the Coast Guard ship is not at the leftmost row of the grid, then left is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent's Y coordinate is decremented by 1.

action(S, right, S2): If the Coast Guard ship is not at the rightmost row of the grid, then right is a valid action that will result in a new state S2 where the agent's Y coordinate is incremented by 1.

These axioms define the possible actions and their effects on the state of the system. The search function is then used to find a path of actions that will take the system from the initial state to the goal state, as defined by the goalCheck predicate.
